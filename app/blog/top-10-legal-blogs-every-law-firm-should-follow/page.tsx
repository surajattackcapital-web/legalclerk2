              Attorneys are not always naturally adept at running successful businesses. Sure, you might have deep expertise in your area of focus, 
              but do you understand how developing trends will affect the flow of clients into your practice? What about changes in the industry? 
              New technologies? Lawyers learn from others, both in law school and in the school of practice management.
